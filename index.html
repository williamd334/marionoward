                        <h2>About Marion</h2>
                        <p class="lead mb-5">Marion Howard, an Auburn resident for over 50 years, initially pursued her degree at the Heywood Memorial Hospital School of Nursing in Gardner, before receiving Master's degrees at Anna Maria University and Boston College. 
                            She spent her professional career in Worcester Hospitals, serving as a Nurse for children and adults with varying needs. 
                            Outside of her career she gave back to the community by serving on the Auburn Board of Health and as a school nurse in both Leicester and Auburn post-retirement. 
                            Her community engagement was a natural fit for her impassioned love of the nursing field and she took every opportunity to share her stories and passion with those around her. 
                            <br><br>
                            Beyond her professional accomplishments, she loved spending her time with family. Marion is the mother to four children: David, Eileen, Kelli, and Michael. She is the proud grandmother of 6 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren! 
                            Marion loves the beaches, specifically at Cape Cod, and has always taken pride in providing a welcoming home to her grandchildren and friends. 
                            Today Marion is surrounded by her loving family and recently celebrated her 86th Birthday! 
                            <br> <br>
                            The Marion D. Howard Nursing Scholarship was set up to exemplify the qualities of Marion and further her passion for developing future generations wanting to serve in healthcare.
